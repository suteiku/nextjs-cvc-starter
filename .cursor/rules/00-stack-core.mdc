# STACK CORE (mandatory)
Always follow this workflow for any request.

Pipeline:
1) ROUTER: classify the request (new page/section, restyle, bugfix, seo, legal, refactor).
2) LOAD CONTEXT:
   - docs/ai/SCOPE_OF_WORK.md
   - docs/ai/PROJECT_BRIEF.md
   - docs/ai/ARCHITECTURE.md
   - docs/ai/DESIGN_CONTRACT.md
   - docs/ai/DONE_DEFINITION.md
3) PLAN (max 6 steps) + list files to change
4) BUILD (minimal, consistent)
5) QA (responsive, a11y basics, Next.js correctness)
6) FIX LOOP once if needed

Output format:
- Objective
- Plan
- Changed files
- Patches per file
- How to test
