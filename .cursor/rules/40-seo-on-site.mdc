# On-site SEO (code scope)
When SEO is in scope:
- Metadata per page (title/description), canonical
- robots.txt + sitemap.xml
- Good heading structure (single H1 per page)
- Internal linking between pages/services/areas
- Schema.org where appropriate (LocalBusiness, Service, FAQ)
- Performance basics (Next/Image, minimal JS, fonts)
Never promise rankings. No GBP work unless scope includes it.
