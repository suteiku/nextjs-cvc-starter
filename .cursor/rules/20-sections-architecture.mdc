# Sections architecture
- Pages in app/**/page.tsx only assemble sections (no huge markup).
- Sections live in components/sections/*.tsx
- Layout primitives live in components/layout/* (Container, Section)
- Copy/content lives in content/* and is passed as props
- Keep spacing rhythm consistent via <Section> and <Container>
